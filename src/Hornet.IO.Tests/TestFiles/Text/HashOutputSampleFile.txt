This file is here so we have something to run
hash tests against for comparison, knowing the hash
of this file from a separate source to make sure
that the string is consistently being output
correctly and pick up any code changes in the 
hash parts of Hornet.IO that might affect its
output.  I think it's unlikely, but you never
know!
